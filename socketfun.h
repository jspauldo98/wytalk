 * Author: Dr. James Plank
 * I go the first version from Dr. James Plank at UT Knoxville. No telling how
 * many versions before or since. 
 *
 * The first two functions are used by the server. Call "serve_socket()" to create
 * the socket that is bound to the specific port. 
 *
 * Then the server calls "accept_connection()", a blocking call, to wait for a
 * client connection request. 
 *
 * The client ONLY needs to use "request_connection()" with the hostname and
 * port number of the server. 
 *
 * The functions have been modified to use getaddrinfo() etc. because the older
 * functions were obsoleted.

/*
 * Do man on socket.h for a good starting place. man 7 socket also gives really
 * heplful information. Well, for some value of helpful.
