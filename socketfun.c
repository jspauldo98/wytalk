 * I got the first version from Dr. James Plank at the 
 * University of Tennessee, Knoxville. No telling how many versions
 * its been through before or since.
 *
 * Refer to the header for all the other includes and a basic howto.
 *
 * October 2014: Need to update the functions here. The gethostbyname() and
 * gethostbyaddr() functions are documented as obsolete and are replaced by
 * getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo().  This will take some work but should not be
 * too bad. 
 *
 * Well that's not right. It was UGLLLLLEEEEEEEE. but it seems to work now.

 *
 * Modified to use the getaddrinfo() function. The man page examples are miserable 
 * because they assume information not in evidence. Like you are supposed to know 
 * that the getaddressinfo second argument is actually a string representation of 
 * the port number that you want to connect to. The man page calls that a 
 * "service".  However, once you give it a service and a hostname, the ai_addr 
 * that is part of the result, or some other aspect, specifies the port. 
 * Unlike the old version where you had to hand-craft the correct address
 * structure. Good luck figuring out it is supposed to be.
